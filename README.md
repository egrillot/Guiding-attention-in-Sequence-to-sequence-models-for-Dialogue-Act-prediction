# Guiding-attention-in-Sequence-to-sequence-models-for-Dialogue-Act-prediction
Implementation of the Guiding attention in Sequence-to-sequence models for Dialogue Act prediction paper

I propose an implementation of different encoder and decoder introduced in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08801) in the framework of a school project. The functions allow the models to be tested directly on the SwDA data available here in zip format. For more information on these, please visit the following [github](https://github.com/cgpotts/swda).
